### James Moor
<img  align="left" width="100"  src="/images/JimProfile.jpg" style="margin:10px 10px"> I'm a graduate of Leeds University Medical School and am now a consultant ENT Surgeon at LGI. My practice mainly deals with treating patients with head and neck cancer and thyroid problems. Cancer managment often involves using a surgical robot and I was the first surgeon in Yorkshire to treat head & neck cancer patients this way. I have research interests in ultra-precise lasers, symptomology of patients on the fast-track suspected cancer pathway and the use of AI to help identify these patients at the earliest possible opportunity.
